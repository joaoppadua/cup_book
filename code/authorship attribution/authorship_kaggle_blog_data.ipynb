Does he feel a pull to move beyond his comfort zone, or is it a natural evolution for him to remain in the Central Heartlands of Faerun, patrolling the darkness that lurks therein? ........ There is room for everyone, and for every player in the saga, Glory Awaits. But what Glory will that be? The Local Hero? The Regional Hero? The Hero of the Land? The Hero of a World? Or the Hero of the Multiverse?'   To respond to this in a way, I would say that Gregory is really having to make a sort of leap of faith to swallow all of this extraplanar stuff.  He gets it and doesn't get it at the same time.  He can understand the world as being a large and changing place, but seeing Father Castillion in the Ethereal plane...well, freaked him out.  To Gregory, it was basically like talking to a ghost, and that is just creepy.  He understands gods, but for there to be something bigger than gods that can take a whole planet and put it in the middle of a nothingness place, it's just a bit much.  Even though he is actually experiencing it, he is still kind of thinking in the back of his mind, 'Yeah....right....whatever you say man.'  And what glory will he find?  Local Hero?  Multiverse?  He would most likely never expect to rise above something between Hero of the Land and Hero of the World.  Frankly, because he doesn't really see/understand the whole multiverse thing, and even being 'Hero of the World' is kind of pretentious in his eyes.  \n",

      "    I'd post this on the RTG Blog, but I can't post there. Could someone either post or e-mail me the resolution to the Catillian situation? As the original hook of our adventure, I'm kind of curious. Thanks.  # posted by IDIC : 10/23/2003 12:53:31 PM     Castillion  was rescued during the collapse by unnamed friends, and is now alive and well in the Ethereal. The party talked with him in the office of Din Dal Kut, who resides on a splinter plane. It seems that when Thulos took Terranel, the 'local group' of the multiverse was torn away with it, and all exist as a miniature multiverse in the in-between-place.   A side result of this occurence is that, according to Castillion, the dead have nowhere to go, and have been gathering at an unknown city for millenia. Castillion is now dedicated to renewing contact with the gods, if possible. He has recommened that the party join forces with the Harpers, a secret society formed by the last Elven bard at the very end of the Great Retreat.   Upon seeing Calleum and the banner of Heironeous in a magical viewing painting/frame on Din Dal Kut's office wall, Burne leapt to join his mentor, and was last seen in a battle in Rashemen, one of the lands that borders the Far East. The act broke the portal, and the party was unable to follow.   Also, Castillon is Ian's father.   Having reached the end of the original journey, Ian and Gregory are beginning to question if they should continue, or return to Tilverton to tell of Castillion's demise -- which was Castillion's request, as the truth would be too difficult to understand.  Players have the option of sending their character off to do something long-term, and create and play a new character. The world stage has expanded wide enough to accomodate such. Once the false murder rap is resolved, the party may see the Breaking of the original Fellowship -- but the beginning of a much larger, world-spanning epic.   # posted by Harmony : 10/23/2003 02:00:31 PM   \n",
